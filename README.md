Using SVM and PCA for tyres failure classification (Politecnico di Milano machine learning 22-23)


## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning project completed during the 2022-2023 semester at Politecnico di Milano University. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to use the code provided in this repository.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on applying machine learning techniques to a dataset. The main tasks I accomplished in this project include:

1. **Data Exploratory Analysis:** 
   - Conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into its structure, characteristics, and potential challenges. 
   - This step is crucial for understanding the data before applying any machine learning algorithms.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handled data preprocessing tasks, which involved removing outliers and addressing missing values in the features. 
   - Data preprocessing is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the data used for machine learning.

3. **SVM with Kernel Selection:** 
   - Explored Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks.
   - Experimented with different kernel functions to find the one that best fits the data.
   - This process likely involved hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** 
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
   - Dimensionality reduction can help improve model performance and reduce computational complexity.
   - After PCA, I re-applied SVM to the transformed data.

5. **Result Visualization and Saving:** 
   - Visualized and saved the results of the experiments.
   - This includes performance metrics, model evaluation plots, or any other relevant outputs.
